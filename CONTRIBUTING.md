# How to contribute
Will keep this on the short side
- Under public/data/wiki you can add your own md file that will be rendered in the wiki section on the website
- if you want to edit any of the JSON under data, please ask for emmet or me (Deecellar) before doing anything, just to make sure we don't break something.
- if you want to help with the code this is the things you need to know:  
    - Nodejs latest
    - Tailwindcss
    - Svelte
    - Marked
    - Rollup
    - Prismjs
    - Typescript
- You don't need to know everything straight away, but is nice to know, you can ask me (Deecellar) anything (The code is quite a mess honestly)

Thanks for taking interest in contributing!
